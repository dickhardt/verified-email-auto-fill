# Verified Email Autocomplete

Verifying control of an email address is a frequent activity on the web today and is used both to prove the user has provided a valid email address, and as a means of authenticating the user when returning to an application. 

Verification is performed by either:

1) sending the user a link they click on or a verification code. This requires the user to switch from the application they are using to their email address and having to wait for the email arrive, and then perform the verification action. This friction often causes drop off in users completing the task.
2) the user logs in with a social login provider such as Apple or Google that provide a verified email address. This requires the application to have set up a relationship with each social provider, and the user to be using one of those services and wanting to share the additional profile information that is also provided in the OpenID Connect flow.

Verified Email Autocomplete enables an application to obtain a verified email address from any Issuer the user wishes to use without any prior registration by the application, and to only share the verified email address improving the privacy aspects of the interaction.

The protocol aligns with the issuer->holder->verifier pattern where the holder is the browser and the verifier is the website requesting a verified email address. The issuer can be any service with a DNS record that the email domain delegates as being authoritative for the email domain.


## Key Concepts


- SD-JWT: A JWT per [SD-JWT link] that is signed by the Issuer and contains an email claim is bound to a public key managed by the . Non-email claims are permitted but not addressed in this doc. Using an SD-JWT blinds the Issuer to the RP that is requesting the verified email and allows separation between issuance of the token by the Issuer to the browser(holder) and presentation of the token to the RP (verifier).

- Issuer: a service that exposes a `issuance_endpoint` that is called to obtain an SD-JWT, and a `jwt_uri` that contains the public keys used to verify the SD-JWT. The Issuer is identified by its domain, an eTLD+1 (eg `issuer.example`). The hostname in all URLs from the Issuer's metadata MUST end with the Issuer's domain. This identifier is what binds the SD-JWT, the DNS delegation, with the Issuer.

> Having a crisp identifier and a format different than OpenID Connect tokens (no leading https://) simplifies verification and has clean bindings between all the services, DNS record, and token.


## User Experience

Verified Email Release: The user navigates to any website that requires a verified email address and an input field to enter the email address. The user focusses on the input field and the browser provides one or emails for the user to select based on emails the user has provided previously to the browser. The user selects a verified email and the app proceeds having obtained the verified email.

> Are emails that can be verified decorated by the browser in the autocomplete UI?
> What UX is presented to the user when the app gets a verified email so the user knows it is already verified?


# Processing Steps

1. **Email Request**
2. **Email Selection**
3. **Token Request**
4. **Token Issuance**
5. **Token Presentation**


## 1. Email Request

User navigates to a site that will act as the RP.

- **1.1** - The RP page has the following HTML in the page:

```html

<input autocomplete="email webidentity">

```

- **1.2** - The page has made this call which has not returned:

```js
try {
  const {token} = await navigator.credentials.get({
    mediation: "conditional",
    identity: {
      providers: [{
        format: "sd-jwt",
        fields: ["email"],
        nonce: "259c5eae-486d-4b0f-b666-2a5b5ce1c925",
      }]
    }
  });
  // send to token to server
} catch ( e ) {
   // no providers or other error
}
```


> Explore not requiring JS and enabling this functionality declaratively by the page having a hidden field that the browser will fill with the SD-JWT that gets posted to the RP server.


## 2. Email Selection 

- **2.1** - User focusses on input field with `autocomplete="email webidentity"`

- **2.2** - The browser displays the list of email addresses it has for the user. 

> Q: Are emails that could be verified decorated for user to understand? 

- **2.3** - User selects an email address from browser selection.


## 3. Token Request

If the RP has performed (1):

- **3.1** - the browser parses the email domain ($EMAIL_DOMAIN) from the email address, looks up the `TXT` record for `email._webidentity.$EMAIL_DOMAIN`, and looks for a string of the form `iss=$ISSUER` where $ISSUER is the issuer identifier. 

example record

```
email._webidentity.email-domain.example   TXT   iss=issuer.example
```

This record confirms that `email-domain.example` has delegated Verified Email Autocomplete to the issuer `issuer.example`.

Note this record MUST also exist for `issuer.example` to support Verified Email Autocomplete.

```
email._webidentity.issuer.example   TXT   iss=issuer.example
```

> Access to DNS records and email is often independent of website deployments. This provides assurance that an issuer is truly authorized as an insider with only access to websites on `issuer.example` could setup an issuer that would grant them verified emails for any email at `issuer.example`.

- **3.2** - if an issuer is found, the browser loads `https://$ISSUER$/.well-known/webidentity` and MUST follow redirects to the same path but with a different subdomain of the Issuer.

For example, `https://issuer.example/.well-known/webidentity` may redirect to `https://accounts.issuer.example/.well-known/webidentity`. 


- **3.3** - the browser confirms that the `.well-known/webidentity` file contains JSON that includes the following properties:

- *issuance_endpoint* - the API endpoint the browser calls to obtain an SD-JWT
- *jwks_uri* - the URL where the issuer provides its public keys to verify the SD-JWT

Each of these properties MUST include the issuer domain as the root of their hostname. 

Following is an example `.well-known/web-identity` file

```json
{
  "issuance_endpoint": "https://accounts.issuer.example/webidentity/issuance",
  "jwks_uri": "https://accounts.issuer.example/webidentity/jwks.json"
}
```

- **3.4** - the browser generates a private / public key and signs a JWT with the private key that has the public key in the JWT header and contains the following claims in the payload:

  - *iss* - the user agent string
  - *aud* - the issuer
  - *iat* - time when the JWT was signed
  - *nonce* - nonce provided by the RP
  - *email* - email address to be verified 

- **3.5** - the browser POSTs to the `issuance_endpoint` of the issuer with 1P cookies with a content-type of `application/json` containing a JSON string with a `request_token` property set to the signed JWT as a JSON string. 

```
\\ cookies
Content-type: application/json

{"request_token":"ey...token_request_jwt"}
```


## 4. Token Issuance

On receipt of a token request:

- **4.1** - the issuer verifies the request_token by:

  - TBD

- **4.2** - the issuer checks if the cookies sent represent a logged in user, and if the logged in user has control of the email provided in the request_token. If so the issuer generates an SD-JWT with the following properties:

  - TBD


- **4.3** - the issuer returns the SD-JWT to the browser as the value of `issued_token` in an `application/json` response.

Example:
```
Content-type: application/json

{"issued_token":"eyssss...."}
```

> In future the issuer versions the issuer cloud prompt the user to login via a URL or with a Passkey request.


## 5. Token Presentation

On receiving the `issued_token`:

- ** 5.1 ** - the browser verifies the token by:

- TBD

- ** 5.2 ** - the browser then creates an SD-JWT+KB by:

- TBD

- ** 5.3 ** - the browser returns the `navigator.credentials.get()` call returns and `credential.token` is an SD-JWT+KB


``` 
// token example and payload
```

> Explore browser setting a hidden field instead so JS is not required

## 6. Token Verification

The RP now has a SD-JWT+KB and verifies by:

- **6.1** - the JS code in the page sends `issued.token` to the RP

- **6.2** - the RP extracts the KB from the SD-JWT+KB, and the header and payload from the SD-JWT

- **6.3** - the RP verifies the `nonce` in the SD-JWT is from the session with the web page

- **6.4** - the RP verifies the KB is bound to the SD-JWT per XXX

- **6.5** - the RP retrieves the TXT record for `email._webidentity` for the email domain, and the the value of the issuer in the record matches the `iss` in the SD-JWT just as the browser did in XX

- **6.6** - the RP retrieves the `.well-known/webidentity` file for the issuer just as the browser did in XX

- **6.7** - the RP verifies SD-JWT using keys from the `jwks_uri` just as the browser did in XX
